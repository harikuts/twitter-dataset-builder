in general there is very little research done on best practices for data curation cleaning annotation even though these steps have more impact on applications than incremental architecture improvements preparing the data is an exercise left to the reader
ml researchers work with fixed benchmark datasets and spend all of their time searching over the knobs they do control architecture amp optimization in applied ml you re likely to spend most of your time on data collection and annotation where your investment will pay off

conscious thought is naturally a product of unconscious thought processes much like life is a product of chemical processes that are clearly not alive but that doesn t mean conscious thought doesn t exist or that life doesn t exist
i think the coming hardships are more likely to become catalysts of progress than triggers of collapse
hardships and setbacks can be catalysts of progress progress doesn t happen without challenges decline happens when we lose the ability to respond to challenges collapse happens when decline accelerates past a point of no return
our particular civilization as a system features significant structural risk factors that could enable collapse but it also has important collapse preventing characteristics i think the latter factors will win out
for the record i don t think civilization will collapse in the near future within the next 400 years not even as a consequence of catastrophic climate change over the next two centuries but we will go through some pretty rough patches
factors of decline are multiplicative e g cultural amp educational deterioration leads to an incompetent government an incompetent government makes a pandemic much worse a bad pandemic accelerates institutional decline
2020 was definitely a step backwards if you re wondering how great civilizations can end up collapsing they just have many 2020s in a row over several decades with exponentially compounding cascade effects at each new development

my tweet above is my main conclusion these attacks may at first seem like they come from many different random faceless people but in fact they come from a very small number of very motivated people using anonymity as a shield and a multiplier
read the tweets yourself and tell me who you think could be writing them
i don t think there s anything we can do about it unfortunately
it s sad one thing i ve found out is that anonymous attacks are often not from randos but from folks who have a specific reason to hide their affiliation identity
the disgraceful behavior of some of the pytorch devs is a rare but glaring exception
i want to stress that the vast majority of people in the python ml open source community are good people over the years i’ve interacted and occasionally collaborated with people from mxnet sklearn cntk caffe theano jax etc all fantastic people…
i’ve had to put up with this stuff since 2017 in 2017 i had to block one of these guys on twitter and it only got worse from there it’s sad and exhausting to say the least
so apparently a pytorch dev has created regularly updated for half a year a parody account to attack me i assume this is done by the same people who send me anonymous emails of insults on a regular basis and who create sockpuppet accounts to bash me on reddit etc

image generation from sentences has come a long way in 5 5 years
something that is super tractable to build right now if you invest in the right dataset and that would have a lot of practical value would be a rendering aid for animated movies

i think each research niche e g neuroscience seismology likely needs toolboxes of specialized tools in particular domain specific data preprocessing and feature engineering tools
our current growth rate is solid and our prospects for 2021 are looking bright i ll post an update to these metrics in 2021 here s to another year full of improvement growth and focusing on delighting our users
overall 2020 has been a difficult year in particular one during which many businesses have cut their exploratory investments in deep learning because of covid causing a slump from march to november however on balance tf keras has still seen modest growth over the year
note that the github metrics are only for the tensorflow repo not the dozens of large tensorflow adjacent repos like the keras repo etc
finally github metrics github makes it possible to track new commits over the last year but doesn t make it possible to track new stars forks watchers hence why i m displaying total numbers for these rather than 2020 increases
deep learning research is an important but small niche 20k users of deep learning out of several millions in total and it is the only niche where pytorch is neck to neck with tensorflow
we can track usage in the research community in two categories arxiv which represents pure deep learning research and google scholar which represents all publications including applications of deep learning to biology medicine etc
mentions in linkedin job posts is a metric that i m not quite sure is meaningful unfortunately it doesn t reflect the stack of companies that hire only the keywords tracked by recruiters
note that the stackoverflow survey listed both tf and keras keras had very strong metrics and i suspect many people checked keras without checking tf so if tf keras was a choice it would have significantly higher numbers here probably around 15 overall usage
there were two worldwide developer surveys in 2020 that measured adoption of various frameworks the one from stackoverflow targeting all developers and the one from kaggle
also note that most of these downloads aren t from humans but are automated downloads from ci systems but none are from google s systems as google doesn t use pypi in a way this metric reflects usage in production
tensorflow has seen 115m downloads in 2020 which nearly doubles its lifetime downloads note that this does not include downloads for all tf adjacent packages like tf nightly the old tensorflow gpu etc
note that we benchmark adoption vs facebook s pytorch because it is the only tf alternative that registers on the scale another option would have been sklearn which has massive adoption but it isn t really a tf alternative in the future i hope we can add jax
here s an overview of key adoption metrics for deep learning frameworks over 2020 downloads developer surveys job posts scientific publications colab usage kaggle notebooks usage github data tensorflow keras 1 deep learning solution
a good tool is one that gets the job done while minimizing developer effort automation amp abstraction flexibility amp hackability documentation amp learnability debugability performance are all factors in the equation to be optimized jointly you can t just focus on one of them
it s just learning to predict the next word in a sentence given the previous words
you can replace the lstm with a transformer if you like we have that exact example on it wouldn t be 50 lines then more like 60 it s not meant to be sota obviously it s a demo not sure why your comment is necessary
all of the problem specific logic fits in 50 lines because language models are conceptually simple a simple api means making conceptually simple things easy to implement
it uses a utility to read text files a text vectorization layer useful for any nlp the lstm layer and the functional api the callbacks infrastructure and the default training loop
of course i should point out it s not 50 lines because keras has some kind of built in solution for text generation it doesn t it s 50 lines because keras makes it easy to implement anything it only uses generic features
massive pullback from all non revenue generating activities such as exploring possible ml applications across the entire spectrum of businesses worldwide
i ve just crunched some adoption data for 2020 i ll finalize it and post it tomorrow spoiler tensorflow keras 1 deep learning solution
in general deep learning frameworks adoption hit a slump in march 2020 with the covid crisis and only started recovering in november 2020 however the slump wasn t dramatic and the recovery has been decent so on balance tensorflow and keras have seen modest growth in 2020
in 2020 over 4m unique visitors over 40m pageviews
that should work fine

if anything remote work makes cities more attractive because of the disappearance of the workplace as the main point of socialization

and remember it s not a gain until you ve sold it and paid your taxes

lots of great answers in this thread thanks a lot to everyone who replied
this is an important feature users need to be able to use the same layer with different trainable settings in different models the model will warn you if trainable has changed since the last compile
each logical step in the training loop maps to one line of code exact mapping from mental model to implementation that training loop supports distributed training and tpu training out of the box without the user having to work for it
here s a very concise dcgan implementation in keras implementing arbitrary deep learning models doesn t get simpler than that
of course see
we re adding that
please see these debugging tips in particular eager execution

happy new year to you too
is the issue with the savedmodel format or h5 savedmodel should be able to do this
have you tried use the sequence class
you should be able to do this straightforwardly in a custom train step just use one optimizer per layer iterate over the layers and do e g opt i apply gradients zip grads slice i layers i trainable weights
diegoar42768769 can you be more specific
in your opinion what s a feature that keras is missing or otherwise something that keras does poorly at this time be extremely specific precise workflow api signature thanks
what s hard is to improvise from little experience in the face of high uncertainty and novelty that s what biological intelligence has evolved for that s what current algorithms and models can t do at all
no matter how stupid the student they can always pass the exam if you give them a set of problems very similar to what they will be tested on reduced task uncertainty and if they re willing to spend countless hours studying them more experience
intelligence simply means moving to a different part of the specificity effort spectrum one where you can master broad tasks with little effort you can always make up for a lack of intelligence by reducing task uncertainty making x more specific or investing more effort
ai can always do specific things as long as they re sufficiently specific and you re investing sufficient effort data the problem with ai isn t that it can t do a specific x it s that it has basically no intelligence at all at this time no general cognitive abilities
the thing with pointing out ai can t do x is that if you keep refining x into something narrow and precise enough you ll eventually cross a threshold where a realistic amount of engineering and training data make x possible
2021 is finally here happy new year everyone
i guess i m just lazy
it keeps surprising me how much easier it is to do difficult things when you re ignorant of what you ll have to do not just the difficulties you ll face but the sheer number of steps that will be involved
are the biases special or does the effect come from tuning a subset of the params of each layer
it should be more effective to distribute the trainable parameters throughout the model rather than just train one single layer of equivalent size somewhere in the model experiment would be to train random subset of each weight variable can be implemented with projections
in general only fine tuning a small subset of the parameter on any large pretained model in any domain is competitive with sometimes better than fine tuning the entire model because these models start overfitting quickly it s a powerful form of regularization
we are surrounded by intelligent systems ecological collective cultural that we don t readily recognize as intelligent because they don t have a body analogous to ours
that happened 15 years later
maybe it s more acceptable because humans are supposed to have more agency over their circumstances compared to dogs
how do we know we re treating a dog well or poorly by the fact it seems happy or stressed anxious if so what do we make of the fact that most humans are coerced into stressful and anxiety laden lives
bots that pass the turing test are to ai research what a david copperfield show in vegas is to physics research and yes his shows do involve some amount of physics and engineering
if you were trying to assess that a matter teleportation occured by asking an audience of witnesses about it you d be encouraging the development of prestidigitation tricks not research in physics this is the same the turing test encourages deception not progress
as a result the turing test does not at all provide incentives to develop greater intelligence it solely encourages developers to figure out how to trick humans into believing a chatbot is intelligent
the major flaw of the turing test is that it entirely abdicates the responsibility of defining intelligence and how to evaluate it the value of a test instead it delegates the task to human judges who themselves don t have a proper definition or a proper evaluation process
the turing test was never a relevant goal for ai we should remember that turing never intended it as a literal test to be passed by a machine designed for that purpose but as a philosophical device in an argument about the nature of thinking
by that point you can t isolate ml research as the source of the issues you have to fix the entire system
ultimately ml will always be just one part of a bigger system and ml research will always just be one slice of the lifecycle of that system often the easiest and least problematic part the problems arise when the entire system meets the real world

in practice empathy is positively correlated with intelligence amp education

the history of life has been a lengthy upgrade from random search to genetic search the next upgrade is intelligent design humans and their ai assistants designing what s next
that s likely how life originally emerged random search over molecule combinations producing increasingly complex molecules amino acids and proteins until hitting the first assemblage that could spontaneously copy itself not unlike random search powered program synthesis
given a supply of energy and a lot of time random search and a selection criterion is enough for order to emerge out of chaos if you re not in a hurry you can solve any problem this way no intelligence required

i sometimes encounter the take modern society has made us soft which makes no sense to me the modern world presents immense complexity amp challenges compared to past environments growth doesn t come from suffering or discomfort per se it comes from surmountable challenges
the arguments for offices are about serendipitous collaboration and social connections but is serendipity impossible over the internet are video amp text fundamentally deficient mediums to create social connections i don t think so
it also dramatically reduces carbon emissions and the lack of commute alone represent a significant quality of life improvement for workers i don t think going back to offices makes any sense
remote work is a powerful equalizer it erases geographic factors of inequality like long commute times reduces the impact of social factors on career advancement reduces instances of harassment and discrimination etc
some days it s tough to believe in the goodness of people the answer to that isn t to fall towards cynicism it s to try to fix it starting with the part of the world you have the most control over yourself
it s mostly the process of civilization not you that really thinks in the sense of producing solutions to human problems it then passes on the solutions to you there is rather little that you could be said to have figured out on your own within your own lifetime
your mind reflects the civilization that shaped it it wouldn t amount to much without it
to caricature you could say that the human brain is merely a short lived mirror of what constitutes the main body of human cognition the thought patterns behaviors and systems we ve collectively evolved over thousands of years
having to figure things out by yourself is extraordinarily inefficient plus risky the primary benefit of civilization is curriculum optimization getting you to the right destination while expending the least amount of experience civilization is integral to human cognition
fundamentally you can t buy goods amp services as a replacement for meaning and wonder
of course education and a rich cultural life as well as free time to enjoy it requires some level of material wealth but my subjective impression both at the individual and national levels is that those with the highest living standards by my metrics are often not the richest
on a bigger scale i d argue that a nation that provides top quality education and access to a rich cultural life to its citizens is providing a better standard of living than one that has a higher gdp per capita but that is largely a cultural wasteland
while it is necessary to be financially comfortable to have a rich cultural life in particular because you need free time it s often much cheaper than funding the sort of lifestyle that society would normally associate with being rich
lots of misinterpretations of this tweet it does not imply that these two things are opposites nor that they re independent it simply means that a rich cultural life enhances your lifestyle and in a strong sense makes your life worth living more than material luxury
the purpose of culture is not to get rich it s the reverse the only satisfying use of money is to enjoy culture in all its forms
i believe cultural wealth is more important than material wealth i e it s better to have a house full of books than to have marble in your bathroom holds true for nations as well
at this point figuring out a different path would require a multi year re engineering of the entire ecosystem
which led to the consolidation of the machine learning community behind these highly effective winners nowadays the entire deep learning software and hardware ecosystem is micro optimized for a small set of techniques
you could say that modern deep learning is the product of a co evolution process between hardware software and algorithms it originally arose thanks to the availability of gpus and cuda then we started optimizing our hardware and software for these specific algos
measuring generalization is hard and gets harder the more data the model is trained on we don t have a good way to do it right now nor is there much research interest in the topic but there should be

likewise with regulations they should target applications not research or technology in an abstract sense
i should add the need for ethics awareness arises from the applications of ai if your work is very theoretical it generally does not have any materialized impact and its potential impact could go in any direction
if your work has impact then by definition it is changing the world you must then ask how the world is changing in which direction does your impact point who benefits and who loses out technological impact always has a moral direction
awareness of human consequences is a necessity in all scientific amp engineering disciplines it s even more important in fields that are high leverage where a very small team consisting entirely of engineers can make a big impact like cs and in particular ai
the lack of awareness of ai ethics issues by ai practitioners has been an ongoing source of very real problems on the other hand i have yet to hear of any harm caused by making ai practitioners think about the implications of their work

war can be too harsh if it destroys you which is certainly something that has happened repeatedly in the past and has caused civilizational regressions e g bronze age collapse but every war has a winner and a loser and the loser may not necessarily end up crushed
the need to rise up to the existential challenge of climate change will likely guide the next chapter of our progress over the next few centuries
i would go as far as saying that the particular environmental and historical circumstances of a civilization program the direction and speed of its progress in an almost deterministic way
starting in the antiquity inter cultural conflict amp cooperation replaced nature as the main catalyser of progress war trade competition started shaping the curriculum of civilization
in the first few millennia of the history of civilization natural environmental constraints were the main driver of and limit to human ingenuity new technology arose from the need to survive in challenging environments
a lack of challenges and hardships is just as big an obstacle to the realization of one s potential as facing hardships so tough they cannot be overcome this applies to individuals and cultures alike
humans develop their full cognitive potential in an environment that is complex amp challenging without being overwhelming similarly the big technological leaps of past civilizations have occurred in response to environmental constraints that were challenging but not too harsh
if these past few years haven t cured impostor syndrome nothing will
in the future it s likely very few people will still be able to freeform write these languages even if they keep painstakingly teaching these skills in school people will forget them quickly enough afterwards due to a lack of usage
another interesting distinction is the one between freeform writing pen amp paper and selection based writing using a keyboard it takes one order of magnitude more time and memory capacity to learn to write japanese or chinese on paper that to type the exact same characters
one may be able to read without being able to speak or even without being able to understand speech and inversely it s also a lot easier to passively understand than to express oneself
speaking a language is not a binary it s a multidimensional spectrum not only that but speaking understanding speech reading and writing are all distinct skills and while they re highly synergistic they overlap a lot less than one may think
the way one uses language at home is extremely narrow compared to the range of ways one may use language in the outside world hence kids who grow up bilingual but don t use their parents language outside tend to have a very limited command of it

this is melanie s talk and christian s talk
you can watch my talk from today s neurips tutorial on abstraction amp reasoning here i ve entirely retyped the caption file so please turn on the subtitles and select english
check out our developer guides such as or
features 52 high quality concise very readable deep learning code examples across different application domains they re a great way to learn about deep learning and keras best practices
you can use this link
not sure i ll post the links if it is
use buy my book you can buy the preview version of the 2nd edition already look at the developer guides at and at the code examples at most effective way to get started
the neurips 2020 tutorial on abstraction amp reasoning i organize with and takes place today
the best feature of cryptocurrency from 2017 to 2020 is that it has served as a magnet for the hype following toxic opportunists looking for a quick buck that would have otherwise be drawn into deep learning we did see an influx of those in 2015 and 2016 sadly
i think the jax team has been doing a great job and the growing popularity of jax in the deep learning research community reflects it
basically if someone is a member of your team start from the assumption that you re on the same team if it turns out you re not on the same team in principle then this should be reflected in practice too
in my opinion personal attacks are never acceptable in a professional environment or anywhere but that s a separate question doing your job must start from the assumption that your colleagues share the same top level goals and only disagree about how to achieve them
the guitarlstm project uses keras to emulate the sound of real guitar amplifiers amp pedals train a model on a few minutes of input output guitar audio then apply it to new sound files to reproduce the same effect
just check out the original court footage it s almost as good as this one

this said abstraction and reasoning in ai systems but the alternative version is actually more interesting
deep learning for auto captioning
possibly in the future yes not in the immediate roadmap though
yes it requires an active and billable gcp account the cost of using tfc is the same as the cost of the underlying compute instances being used tfc is simply an automation layer that saves you from having to manually launch and shut down these instances
try it and let us know your feedback
you can now experiment amp iterate on your model in a kaggle notebook and once it s ready to train at scale launch a training job on google cloud using as much compute as you want just by adding one line

yeah the whole field makes no sense none of us even knows why bn works in the first place the original narrative it reduces covariate shift while intuitive is almost certainly wrong
because bn centers on 0 and your activation is usually a relu though the intuition would hold for any asymmetrical activation
i don t recall if there has been any rigorous study about whether to do conv act bn or conv bn act i always do conv bn act since it s the most intuitive anyone has a good reference
deep learning isn t a science but rather an ever changing set of empirically derived engineering best practices woven together by over claiming unreliable narratives

the innate cognitive priors that we have about the world around us take millions of years to evolve and thus are ancient and shared with non human primates our priors about spatial navigation are even largely shared with species as distant as birds

that would make more sense implies that they found ballots they forgot to count the first time around
definitely not anywhere near the level where it would make results unreliable in any state by 1 2 orders of magnitude but i m wondering why we couldn t get exact numbers
the fact that a recount of 450k votes that were 70 biden leads to a gain of 132 votes for biden is surprising to me is it purely from ballot misclassification if so suggests that around 1 in 1000 to 1 in 3000 ballots get misclassified assuming unbiased errors seems v high

i think it s not an exaggeration to say that everything a company does is a distant echo of the values and the moral character of its founders and the various executives it saw over time and this is just as true for great companies as it is for malfeasant ones
when interacting with people from different companies it strikes me how much company culture shapes people amp filters for certain profiles companies are the sum of their employees and employee behavior is the product of the company s culture which propagates from the top down
i think to get good at something you just need one thing take it seriously enough that you can engage at 100 but not seriously enough that you re afraid to dive in be earnest about the game but remember that it s still a game it s always a game
the fact that today most technological development is no longer driven by war is a remarkable sign of civilization it gives me hope for the future
i got my engineering degree from a very old military school headed by a 4 star general i work in silicon valley which sprouted from the us military industrial complex half of the techs i use in any given day have a military origin most prominently computers amp the internet
for most of our history the development of technology has been inextricably tied to war truly civilian technological progress is a very recent development it only really took off after the end of the cold war

learning a language is in part learning a new way to see the world
one thing you see assholes do often vehemently accuse others of doing the bad things they ve been doing all along projection and hypocrisy are strongly correlated with poor moral character
intuitively the answer to that is that words generally convey affordances and in this case the different counters convey different categories of affordances about the target objects
also birds and bunnies are a distinct category within animals so while there s an animal counter birds and bunnies have their own specific counter bunnies are a type of bird
there s even a counter specifically for chopsticks even though they re cylindrical objects chopsticks are their own semantic category within cylinder like things
so you would say sanba birds and bunnies sanko generic small thing sanmai flat thing sanbon cylindrical thing sandai large vehicle etc in fact there are more distinct counters than i can count it takes a long time to get used to these distinctions
a simple example would be counters in japanese in european languages a counter is just a number so you would say three birds three peanuts three sheets of paper three pens three cars in japanese a counter conveys not just quantity but also various object properties
one of the most difficult things to master in a foreign language cases where the target language uses multiple words subcategories for a concept for which your previous languages only have one word you re simply not used to parse reality into these new subcategories
this is funny because while i ve lived in japan for a few years i have no idea what this twete means
which is why flu vaccines don t last very long but we re able to constantly produce new ones so we re doing ok
the more socially active immune people get reexposed to the virus the higher the chance someone will happen to catch and propagate a variant that can reinfect them
this would accelerate the rate of mutation of the virus by providing spreading opportunities for variants that can reinfect those who developed immunity to the mainstream variant
a key evolutionary pressure on culture is that it can only include concepts and behaviors that can be assimilated by humans in a short period of time since we don t live very long and we re pretty busy as a result culture is optimized for learnability

having solid course correction feedback mechanisms is much more valuable than having good initial intuition about the destination
with tools like colab keras and tensorflow virtually anyone can solve in a day with no initial investment problems that would have required an engineering team working for a quarter and 20k in hardware in 2014
we parse reality by projecting it onto the words and concepts at our disposal having labels for certain things and not for others actively modulates our perception of the world
i often see replies to my tweets that are along the lines of that s just like your opinion man so i want to be absolutely clear following me on twitter may result in exposure to my opinions take appropriate precautions
a subtle and pernicious form of the bike shed effect
i suspect it may be that visuals are protected by a high technical barrier to entry and are more likely to be delegated to pure artists whereas scripts being by nature more accessible are subject to various pressures and approval filters from non artistic decision makers
the average movie is vastly more likely to have great photography and great effects than to have a great script it s not entirely clear why because visual arts are just as difficult as storytelling

more artists should build technology and more engineers should make art
all technology should be humanistic technology created to help its users not to enable its creators to exploit those end users bad things happen when technology gets built by those who do not truly care about people or worse those who see them as a resource
the difference is akin to the gap between drawing cartoon characters and creating new lifeforms
a road takes you from a to b but a road building company takes you from anywhere to anywhere else an operationalized abstraction solves the task for which it was designed but intelligence the ability to produce abstractions can solve arbitrary tasks
in particular don t confuse a model and the ability to produce new models humans excel at operationalizing the abstractions they invent into highly effective machines but so far our machines have close to zero ability to generate abstractions of their own
the territory the map and the cartographer each belong in entirely different categories yet we tend to confuse them with each other the thing the abstraction that captures an actionable aspect of the thing and the intelligence that is capable of generating new abstractions
there is something exhilarating in failing and being able to tell exactly what went wrong it feels more empowering than succeeding and not knowing why

all tech that affects people s lives has an ethical dimension if we build it we have to be aware of how our decisions shape the direction of this impact who we choose to work for matters who we choose to support matters especially for those of us in leadership positions
i m sure there are many people at fb that are well intentioned i m sure lecun has good intentions but what you believe in is irrelevant if your actions don t match your values and if you re in a position of great power there are no excuses anymore
i agree youtube can absolutely do more to fight disinformation and avoid contributing to radicalization i am not involved with youtube but it is my understanding that they take the problem very seriously and they have made great progress since 2016
which is far more momentous and historically significant
i don t think history will remember someone like lecun as a convnet pioneer he will be remembered as the man who was in charge of ai at facebook during the decade when facebook s algorithms weakened democracy worldwide and triggered a global wave of far right populism
it seems that several minor far right blogs individually outperform the nyt on facebook it s not a concentration issue
do trump supporting fb board members and executives have a say in what their algorithm promotes in fact they do
in a majority democrat country nearly 100 of top performing fb content consists of far right propaganda and conspiracies is it because only hardcore right wingers use fb anymore or is it because fb recommendations amplify far right propaganda at the expense of all else
imagine what would have happened behind close doors if the election were run on voting machines managed by a federal agency with a president appointed head 0 chance of a free election
i think this speaks highly to the robustness of american democracy many democracies would not survive a single term with a wannabe autocrat in charge
the 2020 election was a referendum on autocracy period and because almost 4 years passed since the january 2017 inauguration it will take a bit more than an election to move on but it s still entirely doable at this stage
turns out that if you put an authoritarian in power once it s pretty difficulty to get rid of them and it gets exponentially more difficult the longer they stay imagine trying to ask dt to leave the presidency in 2024 after 8 years had he won the 2020 election
for those outside the us this is the secretary of state of the incumbent regime promising that the president who lost the election by a wide margin will stay in power
on some level you know this is just about firing up the base to increase turnout for the georgia runoff and extract additional donations to pay off campaign debt but at the end of the day it s still exactly what autocracy looks like
72 days to go
it s just theater extremely unlikely to result in an actual coup attempt but lots of trumpists will be happy to humiliate themselves in the process regardless
as i understand the main productivity issue in the covid era comes from school closures a fully distributed workforce is not in itself an obstacle to success to the contrary
the idea that everyone who can work remotely will be forced to return to crowded open offices in a year after 1 5 yr of effective fully remote work seems far fetched especially in the bay area which is going to have 4 months of toxic smoke next year and the one after

empathy is to extend an open hand not to pretend that lies are worth just as much as facts that character doesn t matter that the rule of law is just as nice as corruption and autocracy these things do matter remember denazification in germany
the way forward is to say you have an equal place in our world and we will work together to implement policies that benefit you but whitewashing trumpism is categorically unacceptable fully acknowledging who trump was and what he stood for is a necessary step towards healing
this is a question you should ask mark zuckerberg
back to work
trump always goes for the monumental self own rather than admit the slightest mistake it s his character narcissistic and oblivious
and a scared not so bright staffer had to make it happen anyway by booking another four seasons so that their boss could be right they scrolled down the search results and found four seasons total landscaping there you go they said hurriedly dialing the number
it s extremely implausible that someone mistakenly booked four seasons total landscaping for a press conference thinking it was the hotel more likely is that trump tweeted about his press conference at the four seasons then staffers called the hotel which refused to host it
young people are more liberal primarily because as a demographic block they re more diverse
one more twitter is not equivalent to facebook if you re one of the people responding to this thread with but antifa i urge you to get off facebook you re being manipulated
qanon sex fantasies are not equivalent to the 43 accusations of sexual assault against trump the findings of climate scientists are not equivalent to the proclamations of conservative think tanks and so on the two sides are not in fact symmetrical
and no cnn amp nyt are not equivalent to fox news conspiracy theories against biden s family are not equivalent to trump s actual corruption antiracism activists are not equivalent to far right militias life saving medical facts are not equivalent to life endangering lies
maybe the most glaring asymmetry is what was at stake in this election biden won and trump supporters have nothing to fear from this result in policy terms they ll actually end up better off had trump won many people would have definitely not been ok lives were at stake
empathy is good calls for unity are good but let s stop pretending that the two sides are symmetrical and morally equivalent stop saying oh you think x is bad but the other side just thinks the same about you along every dimension the picture is incredibly lopsided
i ve actually chatted with a fair number of trump supporters over the past four years to try to understand how they see the world a noticeable pattern is that they live in an alternate reality with its own set of alternative facts and that s often sustained via facebook
this is also a good take there is a severe education deficit in this country without quality education there can be no collective future
this is a good take need to overhaul the entire social media ecosystem to achieve better information hygiene make the user be in control of how they consume information instead of being puppets in the hands of algorithms designed to maximize engagement radicalization
the choice was between this guy or the other guy and slightly less than half of all voters went for the other guy how do you even begin to fix that
did they change their algorithm can t believe this is not bongino from 1 to 10
this is still the most plausible way to explain the press conference in the four seasons total landscaping parking lot and consistent with his past behavior patterns he always go for the ridiculous self own rather than admit the smallest mistake remember the sharpie map
anyway i m very happy to see this episode of america end in comedy instead of tragedy
how will anyone ever manage to write comedy scripts after 2020 i don t know
now entering the bunker phase of this presidency
this tweet was confusing it turns out you have to take it literally but not seriously there s a small landscaping shop in philly called four seasons total landscaping and rudy is yelling in the parking lot guess the four seasons hotel was not available
democracy wins
likewise i m happy that biden has repeatedly stated that he would respect and represent every american not just those who voted for him that is what we should expect of a real leader
i remember all the 2016 memes about liberal tears and i m glad that i haven t seen a single one about maga tears or the like this time rejoicing in the emotional distress of a defeated opponent is a character flaw even if you do it as an ironic jab
congratulations to president elect
believe it or not when you tabulate a vote cast before the deadline does not impart it with more or less importance
the emotional rollercoaster on election night would have been very different if all ballots had been counted quickly
ga check pa in the morning
seeing the reactions to trump s baseless attempts to delegitimize the election now that he s losing is making me optimistic again trumpism may be strong but democracy in america is still stronger than trumpism
if you plot the linear trendlines for the ga and pa data very linear in the case of pa you see biden winning both though not by much
count the votes not your unhatched chickens
the scientific term for an overfit model is now a needle
our real enemies are those who thrive off of turning neighbors into mortal foes via mass broadcast lies and fear mongering
108 389 new covid cases in the us today highest number so far i worry about the november february period the peak is still to come
a silver lining is that there has been no violence at the polls and although the counting recounting period may be protracted it is likely to remain peaceful
so far biden got 50 2 of all votes over 70m more votes than ever received by a us presidential candidate until now trump got 48 2 2 pts
another thing that keeps surprising me after 11 years on twitter is the awfulness of the replies i always want to believe that it s because aggressive bitter assholes are far more likely to reply than regular folks since the alternative is that we re surrounded by assholes
it s like if your best friend turns out to be a murderer you couldn t foresee it you wouldn t have been their friend if you could i just can t come to terms with the awfulness so i just keep getting my heart broken with every news
time and time again i keep believing in everything good about america and america keeps breaking my heart like in 2016 i m taken by surprise i am fundamentally unable to foresee these things because it would mean having such a low view of america
plenty of ballots left to count and remember things will get bluer over time as mail in ballots get tallied but i hoped we d see a clear winner tonight and the fact that it s looking unlikely is disappointing beyond words

remember that it will take a while to get accurate results and that early extrapolation from small sample sizes is not reliable
today in particular stay away from fox news and facebook propaganda is a weapon
