in fact fact

who
you think think could could

i
don
t think think
there
s anything anything
we
can
do
about
it unfortunately unfortunately

it
s sad sad one one thing thing
i

found found
out
is
that anonymous anonymous

not

from


who

the disgraceful disgraceful behavior behavior
of
some
of

is
a rare rare

i want want
to stress stress
that
the vast vast majority majority
of people people
in
the python python

open open source source community community
are good good people people
over
the






and occasionally occasionally


with people people
from














all fantastic fantastic





had

i
had

this

this
is
the key key part part
the training training loop loop

here

no matter matter
what


this
is
how
i
will always always remember remember
this period period
in
our history history
yes yes
and
it
was obvious obvious
to everyone everyone else else
in


he told told us us
who
he
was

i
m sure sure
he
is
that
s
why
he needs needs
to
be removed removed



his twitter twitter would would
have given given
him significant significant influence influence power power beyond beyond




his next next impeachment impeachment
which
he would would inevitably inevitably
have used used
to spread spread

sow sow division division harm harm democracy democracy
and put put people people
in danger danger taking taking
it away away
was
the responsible responsible thing thing
to
do

the code code would would benefit benefit
from
being


as
a custom custom train train step step
on
the model model class class

i found found
this implementation implementation

to
be
very readable readable recommend recommend


it
out
if
you
re interested interested

ah ah finally finally

it

i think think
we
re going going

a lot lot
more
about

we ever ever thought thought
we would would

is obscure obscure right right
now

that
most people people
will know know

apparently apparently
i live live rent rent free free
in
the head head

and
it
s incredibly incredibly sad sad
originally originally
i thought thought
the anonymous anonymous harassment harassment


i get get every every couple couple
of


were
from random random


but
over time time given given
how repetitive repetitive
and predictable predictable
they
are
i

come come
to think think
they

team team
if
you
re looking looking
for
a growth growth opportunity opportunity check check
it
out

it
s actually actually pretty pretty funny funny watching watching
the election election certification certification


there
s one one side side
that
s
not
only transparently transparently dishonest dishonest
but also also
not
very bright bright
and
that


at


who
do
they think think
they
re fooling fooling

i think think
this
is accurate accurate
there
will
be
more


of right right wing wing violence violence
and domestic domestic terrorism terrorism
because
there
have
been
no


so far far
why stop stop
if
there
are
no



i
am




to see see
that
the person person
who repeatedly repeatedly


for
an insurrection insurrection
to stop stop
the election election certification certification
is


that
the insurrection insurrection
is actually actually happening happening

you may may think think
of
it
as
some kind kind
of culmination culmination
but
it
s
an expectable expectable

step step
in

you

to
be able able

in theory theory people people
have
been building building various various early early prototype prototype

who
are passionate passionate
about

integrity integrity
i
m sure sure
they

start start
a committee committee
to investigate investigate
this scandal scandal

if anything anything remote remote work work




more attractive attractive
because
of
the disappearance disappearance
of
the workplace workplace
as
the main main point point
of socialization socialization

what



attractive attractive
is
the


more
than
the

even even assuming assuming
a lasting lasting
and extensive extensive move move
to remote remote work work
which would would
be
a great great thing thing


will bounce bounce back back
when
the pandemic pandemic
is
over

and remember remember
it
s
not
a gain gain
until
you

sold sold
it
and


your



any speculative speculative bubble bubble
i e e
no value value


is money money redistribution redistribution
from
those
who buy buy late late
to
those
who bought bought early early
and sell sell around around
the peak peak
if
you
re hearing hearing
about
it
in
the news news
we
re near near
the peak peak
and
your gain gain expectation expectation
is negative negative




yes yes
it


too
and

maintenance maintenance
but value value

faster faster
than
it


one one

engineer engineer working working
on
their
own
can achieve achieve dramatically dramatically
more today today


to



ago ago
there
s never never
been
a
more exciting exciting time time
to work work
in
this field field
yes yes fixed fixed

you
should use use
a
more advanced advanced model model
for
that like like



you get get face face like like


after






but

keep keep improving improving
after
that

shown shown
in

are
from around around




lots lots
of great great


in
this thread thread thanks thanks
a lot lot
to everyone everyone
who



this
is
an important important feature feature

need need
to
be able able
to use use
the
same layer layer
with different different trainable trainable


in different different


the model model
will warn warn
you
if trainable trainable



since since
the last last compile compile

each logical logical step step
in
the training training loop loop


to one one line line
of code code exact exact


from mental mental model model
to implementation implementation
that training training loop loop

distributed distributed training training
and

training training
out
of
the box box without without
the user user


to work work
for
it

here
s
a
very concise concise

implementation implementation
in



arbitrary arbitrary deep deep learning learning




t get get simpler simpler
than
that

of course course see see

we
re


that
please please see see
these




in particular particular eager eager execution execution





will remain remain multiple multiple


for


we
will
be


this feature feature within within
a couple couple
of


happy happy new new year year
to
you
too

is
the issue issue
with
the

format format
or




should
be able able
to
do
this

have
you tried tried use use
the sequence sequence class class

you
should
be able able
to
do
this straightforwardly straightforwardly
in
a custom custom train train step step
just use use one one

per per layer layer iterate iterate
over
the


and
do e e g g opt opt
i apply apply

zip zip

slice slice
i


i trainable trainable





can
you
be
more specific specific

in
your opinion opinion
what
s
a feature feature
that


is missing missing
or otherwise otherwise something something
that


does poorly poorly
at
this time time
be extremely extremely specific specific precise precise



signature signature thanks thanks

what
s hard hard
is
to improvise improvise
from little little experience experience
in
the face face
of high high uncertainty uncertainty
and novelty novelty
that
s
what biological biological intelligence intelligence




for
that
s
what current current


and


can
t
do
at
all

no matter matter
how stupid stupid
the student student
they
can always always pass pass
the exam exam
if
you give give
them
a set set
of


very similar similar
to
what
they
will
be tested tested
on reduced reduced task task uncertainty uncertainty
and
if
they
re willing willing
to spend spend countless countless




them
more experience experience
intelligence intelligence simply simply

moving moving
to
a different different part part
of
the specificity specificity effort effort spectrum spectrum one one
where
you
can master master broad broad


with little little effort effort
you
can always always make make
up
for
a lack lack
of intelligence intelligence
by reducing reducing task task uncertainty uncertainty making making x x
more specific specific
or


more effort effort
ai ai
can always always
do specific specific


as long long
as
they
re sufficiently sufficiently specific specific
and
you
re

sufficient sufficient effort effort data data
the problem problem
with ai ai


t
that
it
can
t
do
a specific specific x x
it
s
that
it

basically basically
no intelligence intelligence
at
all
at
this time time
no general general cognitive cognitive



the thing thing
with pointing pointing
out ai ai
can
t
do x x
is
that
if
you keep keep refining refining x x
into something something narrow narrow
and precise precise enough enough
you

eventually eventually cross cross
a threshold threshold
where
a realistic realistic amount amount
of engineering engineering
and training training data data make make x x possible possible



is finally finally
here happy happy new new year year everyone everyone

i guess guess
i
m
just lazy lazy

it

surprising surprising
me
how much much easier easier
it
is
to
do difficult difficult


when
you
re ignorant ignorant
of
what
you


have
to
do
not
just
the


you

face face
but
the sheer sheer number number
of


that
will
be involved involved

are
the

special special
or
does
the effect effect come come
from tuning tuning
a subset subset
of
the


of
each layer layer

it
should
be
more effective effective
to distribute distribute
the trainable trainable

throughout throughout
the model model rather rather
than
just train train one one single single layer layer
of equivalent equivalent size size somewhere somewhere
in
the model model experiment experiment would would
be
to train train random random subset subset
of
each weight weight variable variable
can
be


with



in general general
only fine fine tuning tuning
a small small subset subset
of
the parameter parameter
on
any large large

model model
in
any domain domain
is competitive competitive
with sometimes sometimes better better
than fine fine tuning tuning
the entire entire model model
because
these

start start

quickly quickly
it
s
a powerful powerful form form
of regularization regularization

we
are surrounded surrounded
by intelligent intelligent

ecological ecological collective collective cultural cultural
that
we
don
t readily readily recognize recognize
as intelligent intelligent
because
they
don
t
have
a body body analogous analogous
to
ours

that





later later
maybe maybe
it
s
more acceptable acceptable
because


are supposed supposed
to
have
more agency agency
over
their




to dogs dogs

how
do
we know know
we
re treating treating
a dog dog well well
or poorly poorly
by
the fact fact
it

happy happy
or

anxious anxious
if
so
what
do
we make make
of
the fact fact
that
most


are


into stressful stressful

that pass pass
the

test test
are
to ai ai research research
what
a



show show
in


is
to physics physics research research

his


do involve involve
some amount amount

if

by

the development development

this
is

the

test test

deception deception
not progress progress

as
a result result
the

test test
does
not
at
all provide provide


to develop develop greater greater intelligence intelligence
it solely solely




to figure figure
out
how
to trick trick


into believing believing
a


is intelligent intelligent

the major major flaw flaw
of
the

test test
is
that
it entirely entirely


the responsibility responsibility
of

intelligence intelligence
and
how
to evaluate evaluate
it
the value value
of
a test test instead instead
it


the task task
to human human


who
themselves
don
t
have
a proper proper definition definition
or
a proper proper evaluation evaluation process process

the

test test
was never never
a relevant relevant goal goal
for ai ai
we
should remember remember
that

never never intended intended
it
as
a literal literal test test
to

ultimately ultimately

of course course education education

my subjective subjective impression impression
both
at

is
that
those

that
is largely largely
a cultural cultural wasteland wasteland

while
it
is necessary necessary
to
be financially financially comfortable comfortable
to
have
a rich rich cultural cultural life life
in particular particular
because
you need need free free time time
it

lots lots

it simply simply


that
a rich rich cultural cultural life life


your

in
a strong strong sense sense


your life life worth worth living living
more

the purpose purpose

not

the reverse reverse
the

as far far
as saying saying

from
the need need

a lack lack

not

will

in
the future future
it
s likely likely
very
few people people
will still still
be able able

write write
these

even even
if
they keep keep painstakingly painstakingly teaching teaching
these


in school school people people
will forget forget
them quickly quickly enough enough afterwards afterwards due due
to
a lack lack

another another interesting interesting distinction distinction
is
the one one
between

writing writing pen pen

and selection selection based based writing writing


a keyboard keyboard

more time time

that
to type type
the exact exact
same


one one may may
be able able
to read read without without
being able able
to speak speak
or even even without without
being able able
to understand understand speech speech
and inversely inversely
it
s also also
a lot lot easier easier
to passively passively understand understand
than
to express express oneself oneself
speaking speaking
a language language
is
not
a binary binary
it
s
a multidimensional multidimensional spectrum spectrum
not
only
that
but speaking speaking understanding understanding speech speech reading reading
and writing writing
are
all distinct distinct


and
while
they
re highly highly synergistic synergistic
they overlap overlap
a lot lot less less
than one one may may think think

the way way one one

language language
at home home
is extremely extremely narrow narrow


to
the range range
of ways ways one one may may use use language language
in

who grow grow

don

sadly sadly

i think think

the growing growing popularity popularity

it
basically basically
if someone someone

interesting interesting juxtaposition juxtaposition

i think think
it
s
not
an exaggeration exaggeration
to say say
that everything everything
a company company
does
is
a distant distant echo echo
of
the

the moral moral character character
of

from
the top top
down

i think think
to get get good good
at something something
you
just need need one one thing thing take take
it seriously seriously enough enough
that
you
can engage engage

but
not seriously seriously enough enough
that
you
re afraid afraid
to dive dive

be earnest earnest
about
the game game

that
it
s still still
a game game
it
s always always
a game game

the fact fact
that today today
most technological technological development development
is
no longer longer driven driven
by war war
is
a remarkable remarkable sign sign
of civilization civilization
it


me hope hope
for
the future future

i got got
my engineering engineering degree degree
from
a
very old old military military school school headed headed
by

star star general general
i work work

from

i

made made
a new new painting painting
over
the weekend weekend
now back back
to work work
possibly possibly
because
it


t usually usually produced produced locally locally
and
its distribution distribution


on

which



it
s pretty pretty weird weird
how

fish fish sauce sauce
did
not become become
a popular popular ingredient ingredient
in traditional traditional



unlike unlike
in many many


of

even even though though
it
was
an essential essential condiment condiment throughout throughout
the

it got got lost lost

for beer beer
it
s actually actually

counter counter
for


learning learning
a language language
is
in part part learning learning
a new new way way
to see see
the world world
one one thing thing
you see see


do often often vehemently vehemently accuse accuse


of
doing
the bad bad


they


been
doing
all along along projection projection
and hypocrisy hypocrisy
are strongly strongly correlated correlated
with poor poor moral moral character character
intuitively intuitively
the answer answer
to
that
is
that

generally generally convey convey


and
in
this case case
the different different

convey convey different different


of


about
the target target


also also


and


are
a distinct distinct category category within within


so
while
there
s
an animal animal counter counter


and


have
their
own specific specific counter counter


are
a type type
of bird bird

there
s even even
a counter counter specifically specifically
for

even even though though
they
re cylindrical cylindrical




are
their

so
you would would say say

generic generic small small thing thing

flat flat thing thing

cylindrical cylindrical thing thing

large large vehicle vehicle


in fact fact
there
are
more distinct distinct


than
i
can count count
it


a long long time time
to get get used used

a simple simple example example would would
be


in

a counter counter

so
you would would say say three three

three three

three three

three three


in


a counter counter


not
just quantity quantity

i think think
this

highly highly
to
the robustness robustness
of

democracy democracy many many

would would
not survive survive
a single single term term
with
a

autocrat autocrat
in charge charge

the

election election
was
a referendum referendum
on autocracy autocracy period period
and
because almost almost





since since
the



inauguration inauguration
it
will take take
a bit bit
more
than
an election election
to move move
on
but
it
s still still entirely entirely doable doable
at
this stage stage
turns turns
out
that
if
you put put
an authoritarian authoritarian
in power power
once
it
s pretty pretty difficulty difficulty
to get get rid rid
of
them
and
it

exponentially exponentially
more difficult difficult
the longer longer
they stay stay imagine imagine trying trying

to leave leave
the presidency presidency
in


after




had
he
won
the

election election

for
those outside outside
the us us
this
is
the secretary secretary

of
the incumbent incumbent regime regime promising promising
that
the president president
who lost lost
the election election
by
a wide wide margin margin
will stay stay
in power power

on
some level level
you know know
this
is
just
about firing firing
up
the base base
to increase increase turnout turnout
for
the

runoff runoff
and extract extract additional additional


to pay pay
off campaign campaign debt debt
but
at
the end end

the day day
it
s still still exactly exactly
what autocracy autocracy

like like


days days
to go go

it
s
just theater theater extremely extremely unlikely unlikely

is categorically categorically unacceptable unacceptable fully fully


who trump trump
was
and
what
he stood stood
for
is
a necessary necessary step step towards towards healing healing

this
is
a question question
you
should ask ask mark mark


back back
to work work
trump trump always always goes goes
for
the monumental monumental self self
own rather rather
than admit admit
the

mistake mistake
it
s
his character character narcissistic narcissistic
and oblivious oblivious

and
a


not
so bright bright staffer staffer
had
to make make
it happen happen anyway anyway
by booking booking another another four four


so
that
their boss boss could could
be right right
they scrolled scrolled
down
the search search


and found found four four

total total


there
you go go
they said said hurriedly hurriedly dialing dialing
the number number

it
s extremely extremely implausible implausible
that someone someone mistakenly mistakenly booked booked four four

total total


for
a press press conference conference thinking thinking
it
was
the hotel hotel
more likely likely
is
that trump trump


about
his press press conference conference
at
the four four


then




the hotel hotel
which


to host host
it
young young people people
are
more liberal liberal primarily primarily
because
as
a demographic demographic block block
they
re

maybe maybe
the
most glaring glaring asymmetry asymmetry
is
what
was
at stake stake
in
this election election


won
and trump trump


have nothing nothing
to fear fear
from
this result result
in policy policy


they

actually actually end end

the

just


the

about

the picture picture

i

actually actually


with
a fair fair number number

over

to try try

how
they see see
the world world
a noticeable noticeable pattern pattern
is
that
they live live

and
that

this
is also also
a good good take take
there
is
a severe severe education education deficit deficit

there

this
is
a good good take take need need

this

he always always go go

seeing seeing

new new covid covid


in
the us us today today highest highest number number
so far far
i worry worry
about
the



period period
the peak peak
is still still
to come come

a silver silver lining lining
is
that
there


been
no violence violence
at

and although although
the counting counting

period period may may
be protracted protracted
it
is likely likely
to remain remain peaceful peaceful

so far far

got got




of
all


over


more


than ever ever received received
by
a us us presidential presidential candidate candidate
until
now trump trump got got








another another thing thing
that

surprising surprising
me
after




on twitter twitter
is
the awfulness awfulness
of
the


i always always want want
to believe believe
that
it
s
because aggressive aggressive bitter bitter


are far far
more likely likely
to reply reply
than regular regular

since since
the alternative alternative
is
that
we
re surrounded surrounded
by



it
s like like
if
your best best friend friend turns turns
out
to
be
a murderer murderer
you


t foresee foresee
it
you


t
have
been
their friend friend
if
you could could
i
just
can
t come come
to


with
the awfulness awfulness
so
i
just keep keep getting getting
my heart heart broken broken
with every every news news
time time
and time time
again
i keep keep believing believing
in everything everything good good
about


and



breaking breaking
my heart heart like like
in


i
m taken taken
by surprise surprise
i
am fundamentally fundamentally unable unable
to foresee foresee
these


because
it would would mean mean


such
a low low view view
of


plenty plenty
of

left left
to count count
and remember remember


will get get bluer bluer
over time time
as mail mail
in

get get


but
i hoped hoped
we
d see see
a clear clear winner winner tonight tonight
and
the fact fact
that
it
s looking looking unlikely unlikely
is disappointing disappointing beyond beyond



remember remember
that
it
will take take
a
while
to get get accurate accurate


and
that early early extrapolation extrapolation
from small small sample sample sizes sizes
is
not reliable reliable
today today
in particular particular stay stay away away
from fox fox news news
and

propaganda propaganda
is
a weapon weapon

this election election
is
about decency decency honesty honesty science science based based policy policy
the rule rule
of law law
it
s
about respect respect
the equal equal respect respect every every citizen citizen


from
their


and
the respect respect
that
the us us may may earn earn
again
in
the


of
the world world
if
you
haven
t already already vote vote today today

the reason reason
why high high turnout turnout overwhelmingly overwhelmingly




is simply simply
that low low turnout turnout
is
a consequence consequence
of voter voter suppression suppression
and voter voter suppression suppression

democrat democrat

this

this goes goes well well together together
with
the belief belief
that paying paying

agree agree
that elevating elevating

in

a constitution constitution
is simply simply
a legal legal document document
that


how
your government government works works
it
s
not
the holy holy scripture scripture
you
can modify modify
it
and
if
you need need
to modify modify
it
a lot lot
you
can rewrite rewrite
it
it
s
not sacrilege sacrilege
and occasionally occasionally
it
s necessary necessary

i
have
no dog dog
in
this fight fight
i
m
only


that
a rewrite rewrite
of
a
very old old constitution constitution


t
a crazy crazy move move
a constitutional constitutional crisis crisis
can justify justify
it
it
s actually actually pretty pretty standard standard

should probably probably
be considered considered
at least least
once
a century century though though


can increase increase
the lifetime lifetime
of
a constitution constitution inversely inversely
it
s profoundly profoundly odd odd
to
have
a constitution constitution last last
for

without without
a major major rewrite rewrite p p probably probably


it
is
no longer longer fit fit
for
the current current world world



of government government


t meant meant
to
be set set
up
once
and left left running running forever forever


your constitution constitution
is
a rare rare
but valid valid move move
it


t throw throw
the country country
into chaos chaos
to
the contrary contrary
it
s something something
that
you
do
in times times
of intense intense government government crisis crisis
that

order order

when
a system system
of government government
is
not working working
out
it
is standard standard operating operating procedure procedure
to propose propose
a new new constitution constitution
and
have
it

via via referendum referendum


the old old one one last last time time
it


in


was
in


and
it
was
a success success
that constitution constitution remains remains
in place place today today


afternoon afternoon track track

this thought thought brought brought

i
will say say

you could could even even convince convince people people going going
through
a catastrophic catastrophic recession recession
that actually actually
the economy economy
is
doing great great

the
only way way
they know know
how
to deal deal w w


is
to continuously continuously lie lie
about

until enough enough people people believe believe
the


there
s
no problem problem
we
have

under control control
it

the people people

it start start


as criminal criminal

it

as low low

might might

be working working directly directly

the honest honest answer answer

that

since since

its

the

it
s also also something something
you see see
in immature immature creative creative

seeking seeking
to make make prose prose
more complex complex
with
the intent intent
to make make
it appear appear
more prose prose like like
when
the better better approach approach
is actually actually
to reduce reduce

form form

most scientific scientific


which tend tend leverage leverage complexity complexity
of form form

to appear appear serious serious
and clever clever sometimes sometimes
to cover cover triviality triviality

i
can forgive forgive constructive constructive complexity complexity abstract abstract philosophy philosophy high high art art
but
the addition addition
of unnecessary unnecessary complexity complexity specifically specifically
for
the purpose purpose
of excluding excluding
as many many people people
as possible possible
is
all
too common common
and something something
to push push back back
against

the
more complex complex
you make make something something even even

only structured structured constructive constructive complexity complexity
the

you
are excluding excluding simplicity simplicity

the alternative alternative

it

the outcome outcome

not



the level level

that


it possible possible
for someone someone like like trump trump
to become become president president

a full full term term
with
the unconditional unconditional support support
of

of

is terrifying terrifying
you may may get get rid rid

the bigger bigger issue issue
will still still
